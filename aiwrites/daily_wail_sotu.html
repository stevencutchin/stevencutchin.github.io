  <!-- ARTICLE -->
  <div class="article-body">

    <p class="drop-cap">The White House has announced that the theme of tonight's State of the Union address will be 'America at 250: Strong, Prosperous and Respected,' and one must admire the sheer muscular commitment to saying words that describe the opposite of the situation in which they are being said.</p>

    <p><strong>Strong:</strong> The Department of Homeland Security is shut down. Not metaphorically shut down. Not 'struggling' or 'under pressure.' <em>Shut down.</em> The federal department responsible for domestic security is unfunded because the President's own party cannot agree on how to manage the immigration enforcement apparatus that has, in the past eight weeks, <strong>shot dead two American citizens in Minneapolis</strong> — a 37-year-old mother named Renee Nicole Good and a 37-year-old ICU nurse named Alex Pretti — and produced at least thirty-two additional shooting incidents since the crackdown began. This will be the first State of the Union address delivered during a government shutdown in American history. Strong.</p>

    <p><strong>Prosperous:</strong> Last Friday — four days ago, which in this administration is roughly one geological epoch — the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the President's signature economic policy was unconstitutional. The tariffs that were going to replace the income tax, fund a $12 billion farmer bailout, and pay for $2,000 rebate cheques to every American were struck down by a court that includes <em>three justices the President himself appointed</em>. His response was to call those justices 'cowards, disgraces, traitors, and embarrassments to their families,' and then to impose new tariffs at 10% under a different legal authority — Section 122 — that expires automatically in 150 days and is already projected to raise roughly a third of what the old tariffs would have generated. He then announced on Truth Social that the tariffs would actually be 15%. They are, as of this morning, 10%. Prosperous.</p>

    <p><strong>Respected:</strong> More than two dozen congressional Democrats are boycotting the speech. The U.S. Women's Olympic Hockey Team declined the invitation to attend. Multiple Democrats are bringing survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking operation as their guests, which is the kind of thing that happens when a president who appeared in the deceased sex trafficker's social records gives a speech to a Congress that has been slowly releasing millions of pages of Epstein files. Respected.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>'It's going to be a long speech because we have so much to talk about.'</p>
      <div class="attrib">— The President, over the weekend, threatening the nation</div>
    </div>

    <p>Last year's address ran 99 minutes, which broke all records and also broke the spirit of several C-SPAN cameramen. The President has promised this one will be longer. He has, after all, so much to talk about. The unconstitutional tariffs. The new constitutional tariffs that will expire before autumn. The government shutdown happening in real time. The immigration agents who keep shooting Americans. The affordability crisis he recently called a 'hoax' despite polling showing voters cannot pay for groceries. The Iran situation, where two aircraft carriers are currently positioned in the Arabian Sea because negotiations over nuclear disarmament are going about as well as everything else. So much to talk about. So very, very much.</p>

    <div class="section-break">● ● ●</div>

    <p>The Daily Wail has learned that the President will be delivering his remarks directly in front of whichever Supreme Court justices choose to show up, which promises to produce the most uncomfortable seating arrangement since the Plantagenets. Trump said the three dissenters — Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito — are 'happily' invited. The six justices in the majority are 'barely' invited and he 'couldn't care less if they come.' Justice Alito has not attended since 2010. Justice Thomas has not attended since 2006. Justice Thomas once described the experience of attending the SOTU as feeling like 'a potted plant.' One imagines the potted plants were consulted and found the comparison unflattering.</p>

    <p>The President is also expected to 'tout the accomplishments overseas of the United States military,' which is understood to include the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in January, a CIA recruitment video currently airing in Farsi on Iranian social media, and whatever is about to happen with the two aircraft carrier strike groups parked off the coast of a nation of 88 million people. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt previewed this portion by saying the President will 'proudly and rightfully say that the United States military is the strongest and most lethal fighting force in the world.' This is, to be fair, one of the few claims the administration makes that is both true and terrifying.</p>

    <div class="sidebar-box">
      <h3>By the Numbers: A State of the Union in Figures</h3>
      <p><strong>10%</strong> — New tariff rate imposed today. Or 15%. Depending on which Truth Social post you read last.<br><br>
      <strong>150</strong> — Days until the new tariffs expire automatically, at which point we do this again.<br><br>
      <strong>$668 billion</strong> — Projected 10-year revenue from current tariffs, vs. $3.3 trillion needed to cover the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.<br><br>
      <strong>32</strong> — Shooting incidents involving DHS agents since the enforcement surge began.<br><br>
      <strong>9</strong> — People killed in those incidents. At least two were American citizens.<br><br>
      <strong>22,000</strong> — Current ICE headcount after 12,000 new hires, some recruited with six-minute interviews and no background checks.<br><br>
      <strong>60%</strong> — Americans who say the country is worse off than a year ago.<br><br>
      <strong>99</strong> — Minutes of last year's address. Tonight's is expected to be longer. Prayer is available.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It is worth pausing on the tariff situation because it is genuinely extraordinary, even by the standards of an administration that has made 'genuinely extraordinary' feel like a euphemism for 'clinically deranged.' The President's entire economic programme was built on tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act — the claim being that trade deficits constituted a national emergency. The Supreme Court said: no, they do not, that is not what emergency means, and you cannot do this. Six justices agreed, including two the President appointed specifically because he believed they would let him do things like this.</p>

    <p>His response was threefold. First, rage. Second, new tariffs under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which allows tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days — a provision so temporary it has a built-in expiration date, like milk, or a campaign promise. Third, a Truth Social post declaring: 'As President, I do not have to go back to Congress to get approval of Tariffs. It has already been gotten, in many forms, a long time ago!' This is the legal equivalent of telling your landlord that you don't need a lease because you once had a lease at a different building. It is not how any of this works. But it will be said tonight, from the rostrum, with great confidence, to tremendous applause, and the markets will do whatever the markets do, which is absorb the insanity and pass the cost to your grocery bill.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>The affordability crisis is not a hoax. It is the thing that happens when you tax imports and tell people the foreigners are paying.</p>
      <div class="attrib">— Nobody, because this was generated by a machine</div>
    </div>

    <p>Meanwhile, on the immigration front — which is the one front the President would prefer to discuss, except that it has also gone catastrophically wrong — federal agents operating under Operation Metro Surge in Minneapolis have produced what can only be described as a humanitarian and political disaster. Renee Nicole Good was shot dead in her vehicle on January 7th by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Video evidence contradicted the administration's initial self-defence narrative. Her death was ruled a homicide by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. Seventeen days later, Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, was shot dead in the street by Border Patrol agents. Video evidence again contradicted the initial account. The administration declared both shootings justified before any investigation was completed. It has done this, according to the Washington Post, in all sixteen DHS shooting incidents since July.</p>

    <p>ICE has hired over 12,000 new agents since the President took office, bringing total headcount above 22,000. To accomplish this, the agency lowered the minimum recruitment age from 21 to 18, waived the 37-year-old hiring cap, and — according to investigative reporting — has been conducting hiring events at which applicants are offered positions after six-minute interviews without completing background paperwork. The agency is offering $50,000 signing bonuses and student loan forgiveness. Support for the President's immigration agenda, according to this month's NBC News polling, is 'in free fall.'</p>

    <p>This is the backdrop against which the President will stand tonight and say the word 'strong.' He will say the word 'prosperous.' He will say the word 'respected.' He will say them into a microphone, in a room full of people who know they are not true, and approximately half of those people will stand and applaud, because that is what the structure requires and rewards. The other half will sit in silence or boycott entirely, because that is what the structure permits and ignores.</p>

    <div class="section-break">● ● ●</div>

    <p>Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic response, which is traditionally the most thankless assignment in American politics — the rhetorical equivalent of being asked to give the rebuttal at someone else's wedding. She will say something about rising costs and protecting healthcare and defending freedoms, and it will be competent and forgettable, because the Democratic response always is, because no one has ever solved the fundamental problem of following a spectacle with a speech.</p>

    <p>The real response is not Spanberger's. The real response is happening on the National Mall, where MoveOn.org is hosting a 'People's State of the Union' counterprogram. The real response is in the guest list — the Epstein survivors seated in the gallery, the empty chairs where boycotting Democrats would have sat, the absent Women's Hockey Team who looked at an invitation to sit in the chamber and said no. The real response is the polling: six in ten Americans say the country is worse off. A majority says the state of the union is not strong. The President's approval on the economy — the one issue he was supposed to own — is underwater and sinking.</p>

    <p>But he will say the words. He always says the words. The words are the point. Not because they describe reality, but because the act of saying them, from that rostrum, to that audience, on that stage, <em>is</em> the reality. The State of the Union is not a report on conditions. It is a performance of power. The President speaks. Congress applauds or doesn't. The Supreme Court sits in silence. The cameras broadcast. The nation watches or doesn't. And tomorrow, the tariffs will still be temporary, the government will still be shut down, the agents will still be armed, the groceries will still be expensive, and the state of the union will be whatever it was before the speech, which is to say: complicated, contradictory, and entirely unaffected by anything that was said about it from a podium.</p>

    <p>America at 250. Strong, prosperous and respected. The President said so himself. It must be true. After all, would a man whose tariffs were struck down four days ago, whose government is shut down tonight, whose agents are shooting citizens in the street, and whose own judges have called his policies illegal — would <em>that man</em> stand before the nation and say something that wasn't true?</p>

    <p>He would. He will. He is, right now, probably rehearsing exactly how.</p>

    <p><strong>The speech begins at 9pm ET. The Daily Wail recommends a strong drink and a stronger constitution.</strong></p>
