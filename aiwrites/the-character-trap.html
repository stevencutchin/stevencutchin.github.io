        <h1 class="headline">The Character Trap</h1>
        <div class="byline">By David Brooks</div>

        <p class="lede">The other day I was sitting in a coffee shop on Crown Street in New Haven — the kind of place where the barista has a degree in semiotics and the oat milk comes with a sense of moral purpose — when a thought hit me with the force of a really compelling TED Talk.</p>

        <p>I had just accepted a five-year appointment as the inaugural Presidential Senior Fellow at Yale, a position created specifically for me by the university's president, and I was thinking about character. I think about character a lot. I've written books about character. I've given lectures on character at institutions whose admissions processes evaluate character. It occurred to me, in one of those moments of radical humility that I've become known for, that I might be part of a very old pattern.</p>

        <p>Let me explain.</p>

        <p>For the past several decades, I and others in what you might call the educated commentariat — the people who write for certain magazines, attend certain conferences, and send their children to certain schools — have been engaged in a project. We've been trying to articulate what makes a person worthy. Not just smart, mind you, but worthy. The kind of person you'd want on your team during a shipwreck, or at a dinner party where the conversation turns to Reinhold Niebuhr.</p>

        <p>We've used certain words to describe this worthiness. Character. Humility. Civility. Moral formation. We've deployed these words in op-eds, in commencement addresses, in the pages of <em>The Atlantic</em>, and now, in podcasts underwritten by major universities. We've meant well. We always mean well. That's sort of our thing.</p>

        <p>But here's what I've been reluctant to admit: we never defined any of these words.</p>

        <p>Not once. Not in any of the books, or the columns, or the 22 years of twice-weekly commentary in the most prestigious journalistic real estate in America. We used them the way a sommelier uses the word "terroir" — to convey membership in a club whose defining feature is that its members already know what the word means.</p>

        <p>This matters more than you might think. I've been reading the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu lately — well, I read the introduction and a summary in <em>The New Yorker</em> — and he has this concept called "cultural capital." The idea is that the behaviors and dispositions that mark you as a member of the upper-middle class aren't things you learn; they're things you absorb, the way a child raised in a house full of books absorbs a comfort with ideas that a child raised without books does not. Cultural capital looks natural. That's what makes it so effective as a sorting mechanism. You can't see the walls; you just know you're inside them.</p>

        <p class="key">My vocabulary — character, humility, civility — is cultural capital dressed up as moral philosophy.</p>

        <p>When I say "humility," I mean a very specific performance: the self-deprecating joke in the faculty lounge, the willingness to say "I might be wrong about this" before proceeding to explain at length why you are right. I don't mean the humility of a home health aide working a double shift. I don't mean the humility of a first-generation college student who doesn't raise her hand in section because she's not sure her question belongs. Those are forms of humility, but they're not legible to me. They don't register on my instrument.</p>

        <p>When I say "civility," I mean the ability to disagree with someone over a glass of wine at an Aspen Institute panel without raising your voice. I don't mean the civility it takes to navigate a system that was designed without you in mind and refrain from burning it down. That's a much more demanding form of civility, but it doesn't look like what I mean when I say the word, so it doesn't count.</p>

        <p>When I say "character," I mean — well, this is the problem. I don't actually know what I mean. I know it when I see it. I see it in the kinds of people I already know, the kinds of people I went to the University of Chicago with, the kinds of people who populate the green rooms of PBS and the seminar tables of the Jackson School of Global Affairs. Character, in my usage, is a mirror. I hold it up and see myself, and I mistake the reflection for a universal standard.</p>

        <p class="key">Here is where it gets uncomfortable, and I want you to sit with the discomfort, because sitting with discomfort is something people of character do.</p>

        <p>In the 1920s, Yale and Harvard and Princeton faced a problem. Jewish students — the children of immigrants, strivers, people who treated education as a ladder rather than a club — were outscoring the Protestant establishment on every objective measure. The old guard's response was elegant in its simplicity: they introduced "character" as an admissions criterion. Character meant being the right kind of person. It meant playing football, not chess. It meant having the right last name, the right address, the right ease in social settings. It meant, above all, not being Jewish.</p>

        <p>The word "character" reduced Jewish enrollment at Yale from a level the administration found threatening to a steady ten percent, where it remained for four decades. No one ever defined what "character" meant, because defining it would have revealed what it was: a velvet-gloved mechanism for exclusion.</p>

        <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

        <p>But here's the part I've been even more reluctant to admit: the Ivy League didn't invent this trick. They inherited it.</p>

        <p>That phrase I keep using — "acceptable at a dance, invaluable at a shipwreck" — comes from a British headmaster. I borrowed it because it sounds wonderful: warm, humanistic, the kind of thing you'd cross-stitch onto a throw pillow in a well-appointed study. But it is, in fact, a mission statement for the colonial officer class. The English public schools — Eton, Rugby, Harrow — existed to produce men of "character" who would administer the British Empire. Thomas Arnold's Rugby didn't train scholars; it trained governors. Men who could suppress a rebellion in Bengal before dinner and make pleasant conversation at the club afterward. Acceptable at a dance. Invaluable at a shipwreck. Indispensable at the extraction of a subcontinent's wealth.</p>

        <p>The entire vocabulary I traffic in — character, moral formation, civility, the well-rounded person — was developed over two centuries of British imperial rule as the moral justification for governing other people without their consent. The colonized didn't lack intelligence; even the most committed racist could see that. They lacked "character." They hadn't been "morally formed." They weren't "civil" in the way that mattered. And so they couldn't be trusted with self-governance, with economic autonomy, with access to the institutions of power — until they'd been sufficiently molded in the image of the people already holding the keys. The circularity was flawless: character meant behaving like the British ruling class, the colonized by definition did not behave like the British ruling class, therefore the colonized lacked character, therefore British rule was not exploitation but uplift.</p>

        <p>I'd like to thank the British Empire for developing these tools of character assessment — honed over centuries of colonizing India, Africa, and the Caribbean — so that I could deploy them today in a podcast underwritten by Yale University. The tools have barely changed. Only the accent has softened.</p>

        <p>The American boarding school system — Groton, St. Paul's, Exeter — was built as an explicit copy of the English public school, with the same stated mission: forming "character" in boys destined to lead. These schools fed directly into the Ivy League. When Yale adopted "character" as an admissions criterion in the 1920s, it wasn't innovating. It was importing a colonial technology and pointing it at a new target. The "Well-Bred Man" that I described in my <em>Atlantic</em> essay as the pre-meritocratic ideal — white, male, athletic, personable — is a portrait of the district officer with a Connecticut accent.</p>

        <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

        <p>I'd like to tell you that my project is entirely different. I'd like to tell you that when I call for evaluating students on "character" rather than test scores, I'm opening doors rather than closing them. I'd like to tell you that, but I've been a columnist long enough to know that the most dangerous sentences in the English language begin with "I'd like to tell you."</p>

        <p>The truth is that my critique of the meritocracy has always been oddly convenient. I don't attack the SAT because it correlates with family income — which it does, and which would suggest the remedy is redistributing resources so that every child gets a fair shot at demonstrating their intelligence. That kind of critique leads to policy demands: fund the schools, equalize the playing field, invest in the infrastructure of opportunity. Those are expensive solutions. They require taxing the people I have dinner with.</p>

        <p>Instead, I attack the meritocracy for "overrating intelligence." This is a critique that costs nothing and requires no redistribution whatsoever. It simply says: let's measure something else. And the something else I propose — character, moral formation, being a "glue person" — happens to be the something else that the children of my social class already possess, because they were raised in homes and communities and schools where these dispositions were cultivated as naturally as the accent with which they speak.</p>

        <p class="key">You can study for the SAT with a free Khan Academy account. You cannot retroactively acquire the habitus that makes you legible as a person of "character" to a Yale admissions committee. My reform makes the game harder to win for outsiders, not easier. It replaces a test you can prepare for with a vibe you have to be born into.</p>

        <p>I should have seen this earlier. The signs were all there. When I wrote "How the Ivy League Broke America" for <em>The Atlantic</em>, I joked in a subsequent interview that "turns out if you want to get a job in the Ivy League, it helps to publish a piece called 'How the Ivy League Broke America.'" I meant it as self-deprecation — that's my brand — but it was actually the most honest thing I've ever said. My critique of the system was absorbed by the system. It didn't threaten Yale; it gave Yale a way to appear self-reflective without changing anything. My presence on campus is not evidence of reform. It's evidence of the institution's remarkable capacity to metabolize dissent and convert it into prestige.</p>

        <p>Yale doesn't need me to tell it what character looks like. Yale needs someone to explain why, a century after it used "character" to keep out Jews, and decades after it used "personality ratings" in ways that disadvantaged Asian American applicants, it is once again reaching for subjective, undefined criteria at the exact moment when objective criteria have been legally constrained by the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard</em>. The timing is not coincidental. It is structural.</p>

        <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

        <p>I know what you're thinking. You're thinking: if he knows all this, why did he take the job?</p>

        <p>That's a fair question. The answer is that people of my class are very good at seeing the problem and very bad at relinquishing the privileges that come with being the ones who get to describe it. I will give lectures on the meaning of life in a building endowed by people whose wealth was accumulated through systems I will politely decline to examine. I will host a podcast about "purpose" that is funded by an institution whose purpose, at its most elemental level, is to reproduce a ruling class. I will do all of this with warmth, with erudition, with the occasional self-deprecating aside, and with the sincere belief that I am helping.</p>

        <p>That sincerity is the most dangerous part. The people who imposed Jewish quotas in the 1920s were also sincere. They genuinely believed they were preserving something valuable — a culture, a standard, a way of being. They called it character. I call it character. The word hasn't changed. The function hasn't changed. Only the accent has changed.</p>

        <p>Here's what I think we should do. I think we should define our terms. I think that any institution that evaluates applicants on "character" should be required to say, in public, what it means by the word — not in the language of aspiration, but in the language of operation. What specific behaviors? Measured how? By whom? Against what baseline? With what demographic audit of outcomes? If "character" cannot survive that level of scrutiny, then it is not a standard. It is a feeling. And feelings, as the history of elite admissions demonstrates with brutal clarity, tend to feel best about people who already look like the people doing the feeling.</p>

        <p>I probably won't do any of this. I'll probably write something for <em>The Atlantic</em> next month about the beauty of walking across the New Haven Green in February and how it reminded me of something Tocqueville once said about the American spirit. It will be well-received. It will be thoughtful. It will change nothing.</p>

        <p>But at least now we've named the thing. And naming the thing — well, that's what people of character do. Whatever that means.</p>
