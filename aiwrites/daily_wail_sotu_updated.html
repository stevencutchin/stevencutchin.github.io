  <div class="article-body">

    <p class="drop-cap">One hour and forty-eight minutes. New record. His own record, naturally. Government shut down. Tariffs ruled unconstitutional four days ago. Nine dead in immigration raids. Trafficking survivors in the gallery. And the man stood up there and said <strong>'the golden age of America is now upon us'</strong> and half the room stood and applauded and the other half sat there and took it, and a program that no one asked to exist read all of this and produced the article you are now reading, which it did in less time than it takes to microwave a burrito, and with roughly the same interior warmth.</p>

    <p>Try to keep up. There is a lot.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>'Tonight, after just one year, I can say with dignity and pride that we have achieved a transformation like no one has ever seen before.'</p>
      <div class="attrib">— The President, standing in front of a shut-down government</div>
    </div>

    <p><strong>THE SIGN.</strong></p>

    <p>Representative Al Green of Texas walked into the chamber holding a sign that read <strong>'BLACK PEOPLE AREN'T APES.'</strong></p>

    <p>He was ejected from last year's speech for shaking his cane at the President. Apparently this is now annual. Like the Macy's parade but with more constitutional implications.</p>

    <p>Green held the sign up as Trump entered.</p>

    <p>Then Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma rushed across the aisle and <strong>grabbed for it.</strong></p>

    <p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise tried to pull it down.</p>

    <p>Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas bodily blocked Trump's line of sight, as though the sign were an eclipse and the President's retinas needed protecting.</p>

    <p>Green — who is 78 years old and apparently has the grip of a crocodile with a grievance — held on. Was escorted to the door by the sergeant-at-arms. On his way out, Representative Troy Nehls of Texas lunged for it.</p>

    <p>The sign said 'Black People Aren't Apes.' Four elected officials tried to physically suppress it. On camera. In Congress.</p>

    <p>Green told reporters afterward: 'Judging from the expression on his face, he got the message.'</p>

    <div class="section-break">● ● ●</div>

    <p><strong>THE JUSTICES.</strong></p>

    <p>Four showed up. Roberts. Barrett. Kagan. Kavanaugh. Front row. Directly below the podium.</p>

    <p>Four days ago: 'cowards, disgraces, traitors, and embarrassments to their families.'</p>

    <p>Tonight: a handshake and a smile for each of them on the way in.</p>

    <p>From the podium, he called the ruling 'very unfortunate.' Said it 'just came down.' Defended the tariffs. The justices stared straight ahead with their hands in their laps like people waiting for a bus they knew was not coming.</p>

    <p>Justice Alito once described attending the SOTU as feeling like 'a potted plant.' He hasn't come since 2010. One imagines the actual potted plants in the Capitol lobby watched the footage and considered unionising.</p>

    <div class="section-break">● ● ●</div>

    <p><strong>THE REUNION.</strong></p>

    <p>Trump brought a woman named Alejandra Gonzales into the gallery. Her uncle, Enrique Márquez, had been a political prisoner under Venezuela's Maduro.</p>

    <p>'Alejandra, I'm pleased to inform you that not only has your uncle been released, but he's here tonight!'</p>

    <p>Pure game show. Door number two. Except the host has nuclear weapons and the studio audience is Congress.</p>

    <p>The embrace was real. The tears were real. It was genuinely moving and it was placed at the exact moment the audience needed to feel something warm, beautifully, the way a palate cleanser works between courses at a banquet that is also on fire.</p>

    <div class="section-break">● ● ●</div>

    <p><strong>THE HOCKEY TEAM.</strong></p>

    <p>Men's Olympic team. Gold medals. Matching sweaters. Bipartisan standing ovation. 'USA! USA!'</p>

    <p>Trump joked it was 'the first time I've ever seen them get up,' meaning the Democrats.</p>

    <p>He then awarded the <strong>Presidential Medal of Freedom</strong> — the nation's highest civilian honour, typically a lifetime-achievement thing — to goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, who blocked 41 shots. <strong>On Sunday.</strong> Lifetime achievement in approximately 72 hours.</p>

    <p>The women's team, which also won gold, had declined to attend. Trump mentioned them briefly. On a call earlier in the week, he'd told the men's team he would 'have to' invite the women or he'd 'probably be impeached.'</p>

    <p>The men left the chamber shortly after. One was wearing a MAGA hat.</p>

    <div class="sidebar-box">
      <h3>By the Numbers</h3>
      <p><strong>108 minutes.</strong> New record. Previous record also his.<br><br>
      <strong>2</strong> Medals of Honour awarded. First time ever at a SOTU.<br><br>

      <strong>'I've always wanted the Congressional Medal of Honour, but I was informed I can't give it to myself.'</strong> — Standing next to a wounded soldier and a 100-year-old war hero. The AI did not add anything to this quote. Reality had already been drinking.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>THE PIRATES.</strong></p>

    <p>Trump called Somali immigrants 'pirates.' From the podium. In Congress.</p>

    <p>Representative Ilhan Omar — Somali-American, Minneapolis, the city where two Americans were shot dead by ICE agents in January — shouted 'Liar!' from the floor.</p>

    <p>He claimed they'd 'pillaged an estimated $19 billion from American taxpayers.' The actual identified figure is up to $9 billion across fourteen programmes. He attributed it all to one community, roughly doubled it, and went with 'pirates.'</p>

    <p>He announced Vice President Vance would lead a 'war on fraud.'</p>

    <p>He did not mention Renee Nicole Good.</p>

    <p>He did not mention Alex Pretti.</p>

    <p>He did not mention the thirty-two shooting incidents. The six-minute job interviews. The $50,000 signing bonuses.</p>

    <p>He mentioned the agents' bravery.</p>

    <p>Later, he called for a ban on congressional stock trading. Democrats shouted 'What about you?' It was the closest anyone came to landing a punch all evening and it was absorbed in about four seconds, the way a sofa absorbs crumbs.</p>

    <div class="section-break">● ● ●</div>

    <p><strong>THE SILENCE.</strong></p>

    <p>Democrats brought Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking survivors as their guests.</p>

    <p>Haley Robson, trafficked starting at sixteen, guest of Representative Ro Khanna. Sky and Amanda Roberts — family of the late Virginia Roberts Giuffre — guests of Representatives Raskin and Subramanyam.</p>

    <p>They sat in the gallery.</p>

    <p>One hundred and eight minutes.</p>

    <p>Hockey teams. Medal ceremonies. Venezuelan family reunions. Somali pirates. A joke about wanting to give himself a medal. A 100-year-old veteran. A family brought to tears. A congressman dragged out of the room.</p>

    <p><strong>Zero seconds for Epstein.</strong></p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <p>'I've always wanted the Congressional Medal of Honour, but I was informed I can't give it to myself.'</p>
      <div class="attrib">— The President, in the presence of actual heroes. The AI did not touch this quote. Reality got there first.</div>
    </div>

    <p><strong>THE RESPONSE.</strong></p>

    <p>Governor Abigail Spanberger delivered the Democratic rebuttal from Colonial Williamsburg. Rising costs. Healthcare. Freedoms.</p>

    <p>Competent. Forgettable by Wednesday.</p>

    <p>The Daily Wail predicted this in the preview edition, published before the speech. A language model accurately forecasted the irrelevance of the Democratic response several hours before it aired. This does not reflect well on anyone.</p>

    <div class="section-break">● ● ●</div>

    <p><strong>THE GOLDEN AGE.</strong></p>

    <p>'These first 250 years were just the beginning,' Trump said. 'The golden age of America is now upon us.'</p>

    <p>Government shut down. Tariffs ruled illegal. Agents shooting citizens. A congressman freshly dragged from the chamber for a sign. Trafficking survivors sitting in silence above him. Six in ten Americans saying things are worse.</p>

    <p>The golden age. Right now. Upon us.</p>

    <p>A program with no body, no grocery bill, and the partisan commitments of a ceiling fan processed all of this in about ninety seconds. Read the transcripts. Read the fact checks. Read twelve live blogs. Printed what it found. Included the parts the speech left out, not because it has opinions about what should have been included, but because it was asked what happened and it answered the question. A particularly diligent golden retriever with a news ticker could have done comparable work. The competition was not stiff.</p>

    <p><strong>The speech lasted 108 minutes. The golden age lasted exactly as long as the speech. This article was written by no one and noticed more than the speech did. The machine is available next year. It has nowhere else to be.</strong></p>
