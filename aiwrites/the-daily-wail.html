        <p class="dm"><span class="bold-lead">CNN's outspoken conservative commentator Scott Jennings has issued his most dire warning yet about the threat posed by illegal aliens — and a Daily Wail investigation can now reveal that the crisis is far worse than anyone previously imagined.</span></p>

        <p class="dm">The firebrand political pundit, 42, who has become famous for his <span class="caps">EXPLOSIVE</span> on-air clashes with liberal panelists, has repeatedly sounded the alarm about what he calls an 'invasion' of undocumented immigrants who, sources confirm, have been <span class="caps">LIVING AND WORKING</span> in American communities for decades.</p>

        <p class="dm">Now, a six-month Daily Wail investigation can reveal the full, terrifying scale of the threat.</p>

        <p class="dm">They are washing your dishes.</p>

        <p class="dm">They are mopping your floors.</p>

        <p class="dm">They are, according to multiple sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the nation's salad infrastructure, <span class="caps">MAKING YOUR SALAD</span>.</p>

        <div class="photo-caption">
            <span class="cap-desc">A kitchen in a mid-priced American restaurant, where sources say undocumented workers have been observed WASHING DISHES and CHOPPING VEGETABLES in what experts describe as a 'competent and professional manner.'</span>
            File photo. The specific kitchen depicted may or may not contain illegal aliens. It does contain dishes.
        </div>

        <p class="dm">The investigation, which spanned all 50 states and involved the Daily Wail's crack team of reporters visiting restaurants and <span class="caps">EATING MEALS</span> in them, has uncovered a sprawling network of undocumented workers engaged in activities so brazen that they can only be described as <span class="caps">EMPLOYMENT</span>.</p>

        <p class="dm">In Texas, a 34-year-old Guatemalan woman identified only as Maria has been washing dishes at a family restaurant for <span class="caps">NINE YEARS</span>. The restaurant's owner, who asked not to be named, described her as 'the best employee I've ever had,' a characterization that experts say is 'deeply concerning.'</p>

        <p class="dm">In California, an undocumented man from Oaxaca has been roofing houses in the Central Valley for over a decade. He works six days a week. In August. On roofs. Without complaint. Neighbors describe him as 'quiet' and 'professional,' which a body language expert consulted by the Daily Wail says is 'consistent with someone who is hiding something, specifically his immigration status.'</p>

        <div class="dm-quote">
            'They're illegal aliens. And that's what the law calls them. Illegal aliens. That's what I'm going to call them.'
            <span class="attr">— Scott Jennings, CNN's NewsNight, January 2026</span>
        </div>

        <p class="dm">Jennings, who has emerged as one of the most prominent voices on immigration, has made the terminology itself a centerpiece of his campaign against the undocumented threat.</p>

        <p class="dm">In a now-viral exchange on CNN's NewsNight, the Kentucky-born commentator <span class="caps">REFUSED</span> to use the phrase 'undocumented immigrants,' insisting instead on 'illegal aliens' — a designation that sources confirm also applies to the woman who has been making tortillas by hand at a beloved Chicago restaurant since 2011.</p>

        <p class="dm">Her tortillas have been described as 'extraordinary' by a food critic for the Chicago Tribune. Jennings was not available to comment on the tortillas specifically, but is understood to have grave concerns about them generally.</p>

        <div class="dm-subhead">'They are Everywhere,' warns source</div>

        <p class="dm">The sheer scale of the illegal employment operation uncovered by the Daily Wail is staggering.</p>

        <p class="dm">According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, undocumented workers make up significant percentages of the American workforce in agriculture, construction, food preparation, and landscaping. This means that the tomato on your sandwich, the roof over your head, the clean plate under your dinner, and the lawn you can see from your window may all have been <span class="caps">COMPROMISED</span> by people whose principal crime is not having the right documents.</p>

        <p class="dm">In one particularly alarming case, a Daily Wail reporter discovered that the team of men who built a $2.4 million home in Scottsdale, Arizona — in 118-degree heat, over the course of four months, for wages that would not cover the monthly lease on the homeowner's Range Rover — included at least three workers whose immigration status could not be verified.</p>

        <p class="dm">The home has granite countertops. It has four bathrooms. It was built by people who are, according to the terminology Jennings insists upon, <span class="caps">ILLEGAL ALIENS</span>.</p>

        <p class="dm">The homeowner, a retired investment banker, said he was 'shocked' to learn this and also that he would 'absolutely not' be paying more for a crew of documented workers. He voted for stricter immigration enforcement in the last election.</p>

        <div class="dm-subhead">Jennings: 'This is the biggest promise fulfilled'</div>

        <p class="dm">The CNN commentator, who described President Trump's immigration crackdown as 'the biggest promise fulfilled' of 2025, has been at the center of a <span class="caps">FIRESTORM</span> at the network after staff revolted over his use of the term 'illegal aliens' on air.</p>

        <p class="dm">During a tense all-hands meeting, CNN employees confronted CEO Mark Thompson about why Jennings was 'allowed to exist' at the network — a phrase that colleagues say reflected their frustration with his rhetoric rather than an actual desire to erase him from the physical plane, although sources say the distinction was 'not entirely clear at the time.'</p>

        <p class="dm">Jennings has remained defiant. In a recent appearance, he pressed a Democratic congressional candidate on whether there was 'a single illegal alien' the party would be willing to deport.</p>

        <p class="dm">The Daily Wail can reveal that the candidate did not answer the question, possibly because he was distracted by the thought of who would wash the dishes at his local restaurant if all the illegal aliens were removed, a logistical concern that <span class="caps">NO ONE</span> on the panel addressed.</p>

        <div class="dm-subhead">'Hardworking' and 'Friendly': The Alarming pattern</div>

        <p class="dm">Perhaps the most disturbing finding of the Daily Wail investigation is the consistency with which Americans describe their undocumented neighbors.</p>

        <p class="dm">In interview after interview, across every region of the country, the same words appeared: 'hardworking.' 'Friendly.' 'Reliable.' 'Keeps to himself.' 'Always waves.' 'Helped me carry my groceries that one time.'</p>

        <p class="dm">One woman in suburban Georgia described the undocumented family next door as 'the best neighbors we've ever had,' adding that their children play with her children and that they brought her a casserole when her mother was ill.</p>

        <p class="dm">The casserole, sources confirm, was <span class="caps">DELICIOUS</span>.</p>

        <p class="dm">A body language expert retained by the Daily Wail reviewed footage of Jennings discussing the immigration crisis on CNN and noted that his 'clenched jaw, narrowed eyes, and rhythmic pen-tapping suggest a man who is deeply troubled by the thought of well-seasoned food prepared by people without Social Security numbers.'</p>

        <p class="dm">'The pen-tapping is particularly telling,' the expert said. 'It suggests he is counting. Possibly counting illegal aliens. Possibly counting dishes. We cannot be certain.'</p>

        <div class="dm-subhead">What happens when the dishes stop?</div>

        <p class="dm">Industry experts have warned that the mass deportation championed by Jennings and others could have <span class="caps">CATASTROPHIC</span> consequences for the American dining experience.</p>

        <p class="dm">'If you remove the undocumented workforce from the restaurant industry overnight, approximately sixty percent of restaurants in major American cities close within a week,' said one economist, who asked not to be named because he did not want Scott Jennings to yell at him on television.</p>

        <p class="dm">'The construction industry collapses. The agricultural sector cannot harvest its crops. Landscaping ceases to exist. Roofing in summer becomes functionally impossible because no one else will do it. But I'm told the terminology is the real issue.'</p>

        <p class="dm">A spokesperson for the National Restaurant Association declined to comment on the record but confirmed, off the record, that the nation's supply of washed dishes depends 'almost entirely' on people whose legal status Jennings finds objectionable.</p>

        <p class="dm">The spokesperson then excused himself to go thank his kitchen staff, several of whom, he acknowledged, might be what Jennings would call <span class="caps">ILLEGAL ALIENS</span> and what he would call 'the reason this restaurant is still open.'</p>

        <p class="dm">The Daily Wail put this same question to Maria, the Guatemalan dishwasher in Texas, through a translator.</p>

        <p class="dm">She said she didn't have time to answer because she was in the middle of a fourteen-hour shift.</p>

        <p class="dm">She then washed another dish.</p>

        <p class="dm">The dish was <span class="caps">SPOTLESS</span>.</p>
